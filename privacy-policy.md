# Privacy Policy for Glyph Echo: A Word Puzzle

**Effective Date:** September 27, 2025

## 1. Who We Are
- App: “Glyph Echo: A Word Puzzle” (the “App” or “Service”)  
- Data Controller (sole developer): **Wiktor Zawadzki**  
- Contact: **contact.glyphecho@gmail.com**

## 2. Scope
This Privacy Policy explains what data I collect, how and why I process it, who I share it with, and your choices and rights. By using the App, you agree to the practices described here.

## 3. No Ads; In‑App Purchases Only
- The App **does not display ads** and **does not use advertising networks** or advertising identifiers.
- The App offers optional **in‑app purchases** processed by **Google Play Billing**. I do not receive or store payment card details. I only receive transaction status and the product identifier to grant purchased content (e.g., diamonds, packs, themes included in bundles).
- Note for children: the option to purchase virtual currency (“diamonds”) is **not available** to users **under 13**.

### 3.1 Purchases & Restoration
- **Non‑consumables** (e.g., themes, permanent unlocks) are **restored** by Google Play on the same Google account after reinstall/device change.  
- **Consumables** (e.g., diamonds) are **not restored** by Google Play. If you uninstall the App, consumable balances stored locally may be lost.  
- For **users under 13**, purchases of virtual currency are disabled; non‑consumable purchases (e.g., themes) can still be restored by Google Play.

## 4. What Data I Collect and Why

### 4.1 Data You Provide Voluntarily
- **Google Play Games sign‑in (optional)**  
  I receive your Play Games profile identifier and display name. (I do not receive your Google account email address via this flow.)  
  Purpose: cloud‑save sync (Saved Games), achievements, leaderboards.  
  **Note for children:** users under 13 **cannot log in** using Google Play Games sign‑in.

- **Community level submissions (optional; Level Editor)**  
  If you submit a level for review/publication, I store: the encoded level content, your Play Games ID (creatorId), display name (creatorName), a timestamp, moderation status, and basic level metadata (e.g., target score).  
  Purpose: moderation, abuse prevention, and (if approved) publication.  
  **Note for children:** community content uploads are **disabled** for users under 13.

- **Contact by email (optional)**  
  If you email me, I process your email address and the message content to respond and handle privacy/data requests.

### 4.2 Data Collected Automatically
- **Usage and diagnostics**  
  Anonymous/aggregated events (e.g., sessions/screens) and crash logs.  
  Providers: Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics.  
  Purpose: stability, performance, and quality improvements.  
  Child protection note: analytics are not used for ad personalization (no ads are served).

- **Device information**  
  OS version, device model, and technical identifiers used by analytics/crash reporting for stability and diagnostics. No advertising ID is used for ad serving (since there are no ads).

### 4.3 Gameplay and Personalization Data
- **Cloud saves (Google Play Games: Saved Games)**  
  I store gameplay progress and preferences to sync across devices (e.g., highest unlocked level, selected and unlocked color themes, token balances—hints/skips/diamonds, daily challenge streak and (after completion) that day’s arrangement, rewards calendar status, your own level codes, and per‑level progress states).  
  Purpose: reliable multi‑device sync and restore after reinstall.  
  **Child protection note:** for users under 13, any saving other than local on‑device storage is **blocked**. If local data is lost, it **cannot be restored** by me.

- **Local storage (SharedPreferences)**  
  Similar data may also be stored locally to support offline play and reduce network latency.

### 4.4 Device Permissions
- **Camera (optional)** — used only to scan QR codes for levels. Camera frames are not uploaded or stored by me.  
  **Child protection note:** the QR feature may be restricted for users under 13.

### 4.5 Age Gate & Local Profile Flag
- On first run, the App asks for **age** to enable or disable certain features (e.g., sign‑in, community, currency purchases).  
- The App stores a local **age/profile flag** (e.g., `user_age`) **only on your device** to enforce these restrictions. This flag is **not transmitted** to me.

### 4.6 OS / Device Backup
- Depending on your Android settings, the operating system (e.g., **Android Auto Backup / Google backup**) may back up local App data (such as settings and SharedPreferences) to your Google account and restore it on reinstall. This backup is controlled by the **OS**, not by me. You can manage or disable device backups in your system settings.

## 5. Child Users (Under 13)
- The App is suitable for and may be used by children under 13. The App is designed to minimize data collection and contains **no ads**.
- For users under 13, optional social/community features (e.g., Play Games sign‑in, leaderboards, community level submissions) are **disabled**.
- I do not knowingly collect personal information from children beyond what is necessary to operate the App (e.g., local saves and non‑personal analytics/crash diagnostics).
- If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information contrary to these measures, please contact me so I can remove it.

## 6. Legal Bases (EEA/UK)
Depending on your region, I process data based on:
- **Performance of a contract** (providing the core game and saving progress);
- **Legitimate interests** (analytics, security, diagnostics, abuse prevention);
- **Consent** (e.g., Play Games sign‑in, community submissions);
- **Legal obligations** (where applicable).

## 8. Sharing and Recipients
- **Service providers (processors)** — I share only what is necessary for them to operate on my behalf (see Section 7).
- **Public authorities** — only when required by law.
- **Aggregated/Anonymized data** — I may share aggregate statistics that do not identify individuals.

## 9. Data Retention
- **Cloud saves:** retained until you delete your account/save or per Google’s retention policies.  
- **Analytics/crash data:** retained per provider defaults (e.g., Crashlytics commonly ~90 days; Analytics per configured window).  
- **Community content:** retained until removal or moderation completes; approved content may remain public until withdrawn.  
- **Local age/profile flag:** retained locally until you clear app data or uninstall.

## 10. Your Choices and Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to:
- access, obtain a copy of, correct, or delete your data;
- restrict or object to processing; data portability;
- withdraw consent for optional features—without affecting lawful processing before withdrawal;
- lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

## 11. How to Delete Your Data
- **In‑App:** from the profile menu you can request deletion of your account/data (removing cloud saves and local data).  
- **Email:** contact me at **contact.glyphecho@gmail.com** to request deletion; I will process your request within up to **30 days**. Due to provider backups, complete removal may take additional limited time per their policies.  
- **Note:** community content already published may remain visible until withdrawn; on account deletion I can anonymize or remove it upon request.

## 12. Security
I rely on reputable infrastructure (Google Play Games, Firebase, Firestore) with encryption in transit and industry practices. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; I cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 13. International Data Transfers
Your data may be processed outside your country (e.g., EU/US). I rely on provider safeguards and contractual clauses intended to ensure an adequate level of protection.

## 14. Changes to This Policy
I may update this Policy from time to time. I will post updates in the App and/or on the website with a new effective date. For material changes, I may display an in‑App notice.
