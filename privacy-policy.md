**Effective Date:** July 27, 2025

### 1. Introduction
Wiktor Zawadzki ("I", "me", or "my") built the **Glyph Echo: A Word Puzzle** app (hereinafter "Service") as a free, ad-supported application. This Service is provided by me at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This privacy policy is used to inform you regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use my Service.

By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

### 2. Information Collection and Use
For a better experience while using our Service, I may require you to provide me with certain personally identifiable information. The types of information I collect and the purposes are explained below.

#### Information You Provide Directly
When you choose to log in using your Google account to enable cloud save functionality, I collect the following information from your Google profile:
*   **Name:** To personalize your experience.
*   **Email Address:** To identify your account for the purpose of saving and retrieving game progress.
*   **User ID:** A unique identifier provided by Google to manage your account.

#### Information Collected Automatically
The app uses third-party services that may automatically collect information to identify you and improve the Service. This includes:
*   **Log and Usage Data:** Information about your interaction with the Service, such as session duration, levels completed, and feature usage.
*   **Device Data:** Information about your mobile device, such as device model, operating system version, and unique device identifiers (including the Advertising ID).

### 3. Third-Party Services
The Service uses the following third-party services that may collect information from you. I encourage you to review their privacy policies.

### 4. Use of Tracking Technologies
This Service does not use traditional browser "cookies" explicitly. However, the app and its third-party services (like Google AdMob and Firebase Analytics) use mobile identifiers, such as the Android Advertising ID, to collect information. These identifiers function similarly to cookies, allowing for analytics and the delivery of personalized advertising. You can manage your advertising preferences and reset your Advertising ID in your device's settings.

These third parties have access to your Personal Information to perform the tasks assigned to them on my behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

### 6. Security
I value your trust in providing me your Personal Information. I rely on the security measures of Google Cloud Platform and Firebase to protect your data. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### 7. Childrenâ€™s Privacy
This Service does not knowingly address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I will immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with personal information, please contact me so that I can take the necessary actions.
