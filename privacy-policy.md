Use of Tracking Technologies (Mobile Equivalent of Cookies)
This Service does not use traditional "cookies" explicitly.

Security
I value your trust in providing me your Personal Information. I rely on the security measures of Google Cloud Platform and Firebase to protect your data. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
